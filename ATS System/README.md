Title: Streamlit-based ATS (Applicant Tracking System) with Google's Generative AI Integration

Description:

This project aims to develop a modern Applicant Tracking System (ATS) utilizing Streamlit, a popular Python library for building interactive web applications, and integrating Google's Generative AI for advanced candidate screening. The system will facilitate the recruitment process by allowing users to manage job postings, track applicants, and leverage AI-driven tools for candidate evaluation.

Features:

1. **Streamlit Interface**: The ATS will be built using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for recruiters to manage the hiring process efficiently. Streamlit's simplicity and flexibility make it an ideal choice for rapidly developing interactive web applications.

2. **Job Posting Management**: Recruiters can easily create, edit, and delete job postings through the Streamlit interface. They can specify job requirements, responsibilities, and other details essential for attracting suitable candidates.

3. **Applicant Tracking**: The system enables recruiters to track applicants throughout the hiring process. They can view candidate profiles, resumes, and application status, facilitating effective candidate management.

4. **Google's Generative AI Integration**: Leveraging the power of Google's Generative AI, the ATS offers advanced candidate screening capabilities. The AI model can analyze resumes, extract relevant information, and provide insights to help recruiters identify top candidates efficiently.

5. **Python-dotenv for Environment Configuration**: Python-dotenv is used to manage environment variables, enhancing the security and portability of the application. Sensible configuration handling ensures smooth deployment across different environments.

6. **PDF to Image Conversion**: The system supports PDF to image conversion using the pdf2image library. This feature enables recruiters to extract text from resumes and other documents for analysis by the AI model.

This project is ideal for organizations seeking to streamline their recruitment process by integrating modern technologies such as Streamlit and Google's Generative AI. By providing a user-friendly interface and advanced candidate screening capabilities, the ATS offers a comprehensive solution for efficient talent acquisition.
